## forum blurb

In fantasy, a wizard draws mystic symbols to work a magic spell.
In this demo, you can too! 

Two 6-DOF controllers are required.

At present, there are a few sad caveats:
* The barriers don't actually do anything yet!
* There are no actual creatures to fend off!
* My landscape component doesn't respond to point light sources, so the only effect of writing the day rune is to light up your hands and staff.

For a challenge, surround yourself with barriers (as if you were attacked by demons) and try to keep a complete circle in place!

If you're moved to create a fantasy landscape that can use point light sources, I'd much appreciate such a contribution!
Likewise, creatures to be fended off with the barriers. 

## Staff Orientation (controller grip horizontal) with x=-40Ëš
Quest + Oculus: staff tilted slightly up
Quest + Reality: staff tilted slightly up
Vive Elite + Firefox: "staff pointed slightly up at about 45 degrees"
