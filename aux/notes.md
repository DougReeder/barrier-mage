In fantasy, a wizard draws mystic symbols to work a magic spell.
In my demo, you can too! 

A 6-DOF controller is required.

At present, there are a few sad caveats:
* The tutorial system is not functional, so you have to observe the shape of the symbols and draw them very neatly.
* The barriers don't actually do anything yet!
* There are no actual creatures to fend off!
* My landscape component doesn't respond to point light sources, so the only effect of writing the day rune is to light up your hands and staff.

For a challenge, surround yourself with barriers (as if you were attacked by demons) and try to keep a complete circle in place!

You can also draw circular arcs using the A or X button, but there aren't yet any symbol templates that require them.

If you're moved to create a fantasy landscape that can use point light sources, I'd much appreciate such a contribution!
Likewise, creatures to be fended off with the barriers.
