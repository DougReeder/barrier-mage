# Barrier Mage
In fantasy, a wizard draws mystic symbols to work a magic spell.
In this demo, you can too!

A VR demo using WebXR and [A-Frame](https://aframe.io) requiring a 6-DOF controller.

At present, there are a few sad caveats:
* The tutorial system is not functional, so you have to observe the shape of the symbols and draw them very neatly: ![mystic symbols](assets/symbols.png)

* The barriers don't actually do anything yet!
* There are no actual creatures to fend off!
* My landscape component doesn't respond to point light sources, so the only effect of writing the day rune is to light up your hands and staff.



Press and release a grip button to move your staff to that hand.
Press and hold the trigger on your staff hand to draw a straight segment.
Press and hold the A or X button on your staff hand to draw a circular arc.
~~Press and hold the trigger on your bare hand to fire sparks.~~


If you're moved to create a fantasy landscape that can use point light sources, I'd much appreciate such a contribution!
Likewise, creatures to be fended off with the barriers.
